# 🧪 How to Test Telegram Integration

## ⚠️ Important: API Endpoints Don't Work in Local Dev

The `/api/send-telegram` endpoint **only works when deployed to Vercel**. 

### Why?
- Vite doesn't run serverless functions locally
- The API needs Vercel's infrastructure
- This is normal for serverless APIs!

## ✅ 3 Ways to Test

### Option 1: Deploy to Vercel (Recommended) ⭐

**This is the FASTEST way:**

1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
2. Click "Add New Project"
3. Import `royalcreator1/tesla-web-page`
4. Click "Deploy"
5. **Wait 2 minutes** for deployment
6. **Test your forms** on the live URL
7. ✅ **Telegram messages work!**

**Time:** 2 minutes  
**Difficulty:** Easy (just click deploy)

### Option 2: Use Vercel CLI (Local Testing)

Install Vercel CLI to test locally:

```bash
npm install -g vercel
vercel dev
```

Then visit `http://localhost:3000` - API will work!

### Option 3: Test on Console (Temporary)

For now, forms will:
- ✅ Show success message to users
- ✅ Log data to browser console (F12)
- ❌ Won't send to Telegram (until deployed)

## 🚀 Quick Deploy Steps

```bash
# Already pushed to GitHub!
# Just deploy on Vercel:
# 1. Go to vercel.com
# 2. Import from GitHub
# 3. Click Deploy
# Done! 🎉
```

## 📝 What's Currently Working

- ✅ All forms are functional
- ✅ Success messages show
- ✅ Data validation works
- ✅ Beautiful modals work
- ❌ Telegram requires deployment

## 🎯 After Deployment

Forms will:
1. Send data to your API
2. API forwards to Telegram
3. You receive messages instantly!

## 💡 Why This Happens

```
Local:    Browser → /api/send-telegram ❌ (doesn't exist locally)
Deployed: Browser → /api/send-telegram ✅ (works on Vercel)
```

**Solution:** Deploy to Vercel (takes 2 minutes)
